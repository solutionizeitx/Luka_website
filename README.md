# Creative Agency Landing (Starter)

Files added:
- index.html — main landing page
- css/styles.css — custom styles and parallax helper
- js/scripts.js — small scripts (parallax, anchor offset, year)

Usage:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace placeholder logo and images (they are remote placeholders).
3. Edit copy and colors in `css/styles.css` as needed.

Notes:
- Uses Bootstrap via CDN.
- Parallax uses CSS `background-attachment: fixed` with a small JS tweak for smoother motion.
